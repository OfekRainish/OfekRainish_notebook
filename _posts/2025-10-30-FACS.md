# FACS Sample Preparation and Analysis Protocol

## Overview
This protocol describes the preparation of bacterial samples treated with and without surfactin for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Samples are taken from multiple time points, diluted, sonicated, filtered, and stained prior to loading onto a 96-well plate for FACS.

---

## Materials
- Frozen experimental samples (stored at -80 °C in 1 µL glutaraldehyde per 200 µL sample)
- Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
- 15 mL Falcon tubes
- 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes
- 40 µm cell strainers or filters
- FACS beads
- FACS Cyber Green stain (orange-colored)
- 96-well microplate
- Sonicator (28 kHz)
- Pipettes and sterile tips

## Procedure

### 1. Sample Dilution
1. Prepare 9 × 2 = 18 Falcon tubes (15 mL each) plus one additional tube for the LB control (total = 19 tubes).  
2. Into each Falcon tube, add **4995 µL PBS**.
3. Thaw the original frozen samples (200 µL + 1 µL glutaraldehyde) briefly on ice.
4. For each sample, transfer **5 µL** of the thawed material into the corresponding PBS tube to achieve a **1:1000 dilution**.

**Samples and conditions:**
- Time points: 0 h, 8 h, 16 h, 20 h, 24 h, 28 h, 34 h, 38 h, 42 h  
- Conditions: ± Surfactin  
- Control: LB medium (also preserved with glutaraldehyde)

### 2. Sonication
1. vortex 5 sec
2. Place all 19 Falcon tubes in a 28 kHz sonicator.
3. Sonicate each tube for **5 seconds** to disperse potential aggregates.

---

### 3. Filtration
1. Label **19 Eppendorf tubes (1.5 mL)**.
2. vortex 5 sec
3. Using a 40 µm filter, transfer **1 mL** from each 15 mL Falcon tube into its corresponding Eppendorf.
   - This step ensures removal of large aggregates or debris.

---

### 4. Staining and Bead Addition
1. To each Eppendorf tube, add:
   - **5 µL FACS beads**
   - **5 µL FACS Cyber Green stain**
2. Mix gently by pipetting.

---

### 5. Plate Loading
1. Using a 96-well plate, load **3 technical replicates** per sample:
   - Each well: **200 µL**
   - Total wells: 19 samples × 3 replicates = 57 wells.
2. Seal the plate and proceed with FACS analysis.

---

## Notes
- Keep all samples protected from light after staining.
- Perform FACS analysis as soon as possible after preparation.
- The LB control serves as a background reference for autofluorescence.
