# MALDI Dry Drop Experiment – Sample Preparation Protocol

## Experiment Goal
The goal of this experiment is to identify compounds that:
- Appear in *Paenibacillus dendritiformis* colonies exposed to surfactin but not in control colonies
- Appear in control colonies but not in surfactin-treated colonies
- Change over time (1, 2, and 3 nights of growth)

---

## Biological Sample Preparation

### Colony Growth Setup
*Paenibacillus dendritiformis* colonies were grown on bacto peptone agar plates under two conditions:

1. **Treatment Plate**
   - Surfactin placed ~1 cm from colony
   - Amount of surfactin: **0.01 mg**
   - Replicates: **4 colonies**

2. **Control Plate**
   - 100% methanol placed ~1 cm from colony (instead of surfactin)
   - Replicates: **4 colonies**

## Sampling Strategy

At each sampling time point:
- 1 night (1ON)
- 2 nights (2ON)
- 3 nights (3ON)

Samples were collected from each plate from three spatial regions:

1. Back of colony (farthest from surfactin/methanol)
2. Center of colony
3. Interaction zone (between colony and surfactin/methanol source)

Total samples per time point:
- 3 locations × 2 conditions = **6 samples per time point**

---

## Sample Transfer to MALDI Plate

For each sample:
1. Use sterile seeding stick
2. Gently transfer small amount of colony material
3. Deposit directly onto MALDI polished target plate

---

## MALDI Matrix Background (Concept)

The MALDI matrix serves two main roles:
1. Protects sample from direct laser damage
2. Assists ionization of analytes during laser desorption

---

## Matrix Preparation

### Matrix Solvent Composition
Matrix solvent consisted of:
- 70% __________
- 30% __________

### Matrix Components
Possible matrix acids used:
- 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB)
- α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA)

General usage:
- HCCA → typically used for small proteins and peptides
- DHB → typically used for carbohydrates and glycopeptides
- Combination of matrices can be used

---

## Sample Matrix Application

For colony samples:
- Super-saturated HCCA solution used
- Volume added: **1 µL matrix per sample**
- Pipet gently to mix matrix and biological material

---

## Calibration Standard Preparation

Peptide standard mix used for instrument calibration.

For calibration spots:
- 0.5 µL peptide mix
- 0.5 µL matrix solution

Matrix composition for calibration:
- 1:1 HCCA : DHB
- Contains TFA (concentration: ______)

---

## MALDI Instrument Measurement

### Calibration
Before measuring biological samples:
1. Measure peptide calibration mix
2. Verify expected peptide peaks are detected
3. Adjust calibration if needed

---

### Sample Measurement
After calibration:
- Laser fired at each sample spot
- Multiple spectra acquired per spot

### Spectrum Quality Criteria
Spectra considered acceptable if:
- Signal intensity ~10⁴ – 10⁵
- Low background noise
- Clear peak structure
