# MALDI Dry Drop Experiment – Sample Preparation Protocol

## Experiment Goal
The goal of this experiment is to identify compounds that:
- Appear in *Paenibacillus dendritiformis* colonies exposed to surfactin but not in control colonies
- Appear in control colonies but not in surfactin-treated colonies
- Change over time (1, 2, and 3 nights of growth)

---

## Biological Sample Preparation

### Colony Growth Setup
*Paenibacillus dendritiformis* colonies were grown on bacto peptone agar plates under two conditions:

1. **Treatment Plate**
   - Surfactin placed ~1 cm from colony
   - Amount of surfactin: **0.01 mg**
   - Replicates: **4 colonies**

2. **Control Plate**
   - 100% methanol placed ~1 cm from colony (instead of surfactin)
   - Replicates: **4 colonies**

---

## Sampling Strategy

At each sampling time point:
- 1 night (1ON)
- 2 nights (2ON)
- 3 nights (3ON)

Samples were collected from each plate from three spatial regions:

1. Back of colony (farthest from surfactin/methanol)
2. Center of colony
3. Interaction zone (between colony and surfactin/methanol source)

Total samples per time point:
- 3 locations × 2 conditions = **6 samples per time point**

---

## Sample Transfer to MALDI Plate

For each sample:
1. Use sterile seeding stick
2. Gently transfer small amount of colony material
3. Deposit directly onto MALDI polished target plate

---

## MALDI Matrix Background (Concept)

The MALDI matrix serves two main roles:
1. Protects sample from direct laser damage
2. Assists ionization of analytes during laser desorption

---

## Matrix Preparation

### Matrix Solvent Composition
Matrix solvent consisted of:
- 70% Acetonitrile 
- 30% clean water
### Matrix Components
Possible matrix acids used:
- 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB)
- α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA)

These acide are added to a concentration of 100mg to 10mL.

- You might want to add more acids like formic acid/TFA (0.1%, for example 10 microliter in 10mL).


General usage:
- HCCA → typically used for small proteins and peptides
- DHB → typically used for carbohydrates and glycopeptides
- Combination of matrices can be used

---

## Sample Matrix Application

For colony samples:
- Super-saturated HCCA solution used
- Volume added: **1 µL matrix per sample**
- Pipet gently to mix matrix and biological material

---

## Calibration Standard Preparation

Peptide standard mix used for instrument calibration.

For calibration spots:
- 0.5 µL peptide mix
- 0.5 µL matrix solution

Matrix composition for calibration:
- 1:1 HCCA : DHB
- Contains TFA-99% (concentration:0.1%)

---

## MALDI Instrument Measurement

### Calibration
Before measuring biological samples:
1. Measure peptide calibration mix
2. Verify expected peptide peaks are detected
3. Adjust calibration if needed

---

### Sample Measurement
After calibration:
- Laser fired at each sample spot
- Multiple spectra acquired per spot

### Spectrum Quality Criteria
Spectra considered acceptable if:
- Signal intensity ~10⁴ – 10⁵
- Low background noise
- Clear peak structure

## Coating (relevant for imaging)

1. First, turn on 3 switches.
2. Turn on gas (turn to almost 1 as seen in the picture).

3. Open the computer and the device software, and select a method (we usually choose the last method called "Tal"). There we select the type of surface we want to cover (plate/slide). We can also increase or decrease the area we want to cover. We click "Start" and we will see a temperature gauge start to rise. In the meantime, we will do other things.

4. The next thing we want to do is clean the pump. To do this:

A. We will release the pressure by turning the handle (counterclockwise) and we will see on the display that the pressure drops to 0.

B. We will press and hold (hold for a second) the "play" button and we will see that there is a drip from the waste tube. We will repeat the operation two more times.

c. We will turn the handle back and see the pressure rise again to the initial pressure (~35).

5. Now we will clean the loop:

We will inject about 5ml of cleaning agent into the loop and see it know in the waste bottle. We will note that we will not inject bubbles.
![](../images/coating/25.png)

6. At this point the temperature should already reach the correct degrees (they will appear in green) and we will be able to inject the matrix that we want to cover with. We will inject 5ml into the loop and note that we do not inject into the loop.
7. We will switch from load to Spray.

8. On the computer, we select to start the coating "CONTINUE".
