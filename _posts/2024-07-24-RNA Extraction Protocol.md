## Reagents, Consumables, and Equipment to be Supplied by the User

### Reagents
- 96-100% ethanol

### Consumables
- 1.5 mL nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes with lids
- 2.0 mL nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes with lids
- Additional Collection Tubes (2 mL) (optional)
- Disposable pipette tips

### Equipment
- Manual pipettors
- Centrifuge for microcentrifuge tubes
- Personal protection equipment (e.g., lab coat, gloves, goggles)
- Sample disruption device (for bead tubes)


## Preparation Steps

1. **Check Lysis Buffer RST1 for precipitates**. Dissolve any precipitate by incubating the buffer at 40-50°C.
2. **Prepare rDNase reaction mixture** with rDNase reconstituted in Reaction Buffer for rDNA or thaw appropriate aliquots from -20°C freezer and keep rDNase on ice until use.
3. For each RNA extraction, 80 µL of reconstituted rDNase is used.

### Bacterial Populations

- **Paenibacillus dendritiformis (Pd)** strain C454 grown in liquid LB medium at 30°C, shaking at 200 rpm for three days.
- **Bacillus subtilis (Bs)** strain 3610 grown in liquid LB medium at 30°C, shaking at 150 rpm for one day.

**Wear lab coat, goggles, and gloves throughout the entire procedure.**

## Protocol

### 1. Prepare Sample

- Centrifuge the starter test tubes of the bacteria at 7000 × g for 5 minutes.
- Discard the supernatant and use the pellet as the starting material.
- Add 660 µL **Buffer RST1** to the starter tube with the sample and resuspend with a pipettor.
- Transfer all contents of the test tubes (sample and **Buffer RST1**) into the bead tube and add 200 µL of NucleoZOL.

### 2. Lyse Sample

- Agitate the NucleoSpin® Bead Tube in the MN Bead Tube Holder on a Vortex-Genie® 2. Vortex the samples at full speed at room temperature (15-25°C) for 10 minutes.
- Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 13,000 × g.
- Transfer 510 µL of the supernatant to a fresh 2 mL microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf).

### 3. Precipitate Contaminants

- Add 140 µL **Buffer RST2**, close the lid, and vortex for 5 seconds.
- Centrifuge for 3 minutes at 13,000 × g.

### 4. Filter Lysate

- Place a NucleoSpin® Inhibitor Removal Column (red ring) in a Collection Tube (Eppendorf).
- Avoiding the pellet, transfer 600 µL of the cleared lysate onto the NucleoSpin® Inhibitor Removal Column.
- Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 × g.
- Discard the NucleoSpin® Inhibitor Removal Column.

### 5. Adjust Binding Conditions

- Add 180 µL **Buffer RST2** to the flowthrough.
- Close the lid and vortex for 5 seconds.

### 6. Bind RNA

- Place a NucleoSpin® RNA Stool Column (light blue ring) in a clean Collection Tube.
- Load 600 µL sample onto the column.
- Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 × g.
- Discard flowthrough and place the column back into the collection tube.
- *If you have more than 600 µL, repeat the process with the same column.*

### 7. Wash Silica Membrane and Digest DNA

1. **1st Wash:**
   - Add 600 µL **Buffer RST3** to the NucleoSpin® RNA Stool Column.
   - Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 × g.
   - Discard flowthrough and place the column back into the collection tube.

2. **Digest DNA:**
   - Apply 80 µL rDNase reaction mixture directly onto the center of the silica membrane of the column. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes.

3. **2nd Wash:**
   - Add 600 µL **Buffer RST4** to the NucleoSpin® RNA Stool Column.
   - Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 × g.
   - Discard flowthrough and place the column back into the collection tube.

4. **3rd Wash:**
   - Add 600 µL **Buffer RST2** to the NucleoSpin® RNA Stool Column.
   - Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 × g.
   - Discard flowthrough and place the column back into the collection tube.

5. **4th Wash:**
   - Add 600 µL **Buffer RST5** to the NucleoSpin® RNA Stool Column.
   - Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 × g.
   - Discard flowthrough and place the column back into the collection tube.

### 8. Dry Silica Membrane

- Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 13,000 × g.

### 9. Elute RNA

- Place the NucleoSpin® RNA Stool Column into a new nuclease-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (not provided).
- Add 100 µL RNase-free H2O to the column.
- Close the lid and centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 × g.
- Discard the NucleoSpin® RNA Stool Column.
- Vortex each microcentrifuge tube for 2 seconds.

## Results

The quality of the extraction and its concentration for both bacteria were tested using a nanodrop device.

- **Paenibacillus dendritiformis (Pd):** 
  - Concentration: 83 ng/µL
  - A260/A280 ratio: 2.15

- **Bacillus subtilis (Bs):**
  - Concentration: 80.5 ng/µL
  - A260/A280 ratio: 2.15

According to the protocol, the A260/A280 ratio should be between 1.8 and 2.2. Values below 1.8 indicate protein contamination. DNA contamination will be tested separately in the qPCR process.
