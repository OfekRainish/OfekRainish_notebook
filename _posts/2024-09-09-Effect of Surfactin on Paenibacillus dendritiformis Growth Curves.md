# Protocol: Effect of Surfactin on *Paenibacillus dendritiformis* Growth Curves

**Objective**:  
Evaluate how different concentrations of surfactin (6.25 µM, 12.5 µM, 25 µM) affect the growth of *Paenibacillus dendritiformis* using a plate reader over a 67-hour period with hourly measurements.

## Materials
- *Paenibacillus dendritiformis* stock (-80°C)
- LB medium
- Surfactin solution (1 mg/mL)
- Ethanol (100%)
- Plate reader (600 nm OD)
- 96-well plate
- Pipettes and tips
- Vortex
- Test tubes
- Breathing test tube

## Procedure

### 1. Bacterial Growth
1. Thaw *P. dendritiformis* from stock and grow in a breathing test tube containing LB medium at 30°C with shaking at 200 RPM for 48 hours.
2. After incubation, vortex the test tube and mix thoroughly to disrupt the bacterial structure.
3. Measure the OD of the bacterial culture at 600 nm using a plate reader.
4. Adjust the culture to OD ~0.1 by diluting with fresh LB medium.

### 2. Preparation of Surfactin Treatments
Prepare the following treatments in "mother" test tubes (final volume of 1000 µL each):
- 6.25 µM Surfactin
- 12.5 µM Surfactin
- 25 µM Surfactin
- No surfactin (control)
- 50 µM ethanol (control with ethanol)
- LB only (blank control)

#### Surfactin Dilution Calculations

The stock surfactin solution has a concentration of **1 mg/mL**, which corresponds to **965.2 µM**. We will dilute this stock solution to prepare the desired concentrations (6.25 µM, 12.5 µM, and 25 µM) using the formula:  


C1 * V1 = C2 * V2


Where:
- **C1** = initial concentration of surfactin (965.2 µM)
- **V1** = volume of stock surfactin to be added
- **C2** = desired concentration of surfactin (6.25 µM, 12.5 µM, 25 µM)
- **V2** = final volume of the solution (1000 µL)


For example to prepare a 12.5 µM solution of surfactin, take **12.9 µL** of the 1 mg/mL stock surfactin solution and add LB medium to make the total volume **1000 µL**.


### 3. Plate Preparation
Prepare a 96-well plate with three technical replicates for each treatment:
- 3 wells: 200 µL LB + *P. dendritiformis* + 6.25 µM Surfactin
- 3 wells: 200 µL LB + *P. dendritiformis* + 12.5 µM Surfactin
- 3 wells: 200 µL LB + *P. dendritiformis* + 25 µM Surfactin
- 3 wells: 200 µL LB + *P. dendritiformis* (no surfactin)
- 3 wells: 200 µL LB + *P. dendritiformis* + 50 µM ethanol (100% control)
- 3 wells: 200 µL LB only (blank control)

### 4. Plate Reader Settings
- Measure OD at 600 nm every hour for 67 hours (68 measurements in total).
- Shake plate at high intensity for 5 minutes before each measurement.
