# Protocol: RNA Extraction for RNA-seq of *Paenibacillus dendritiformis* with and without Surfactin

## Objective
To extract RNA from *Paenibacillus dendritiformis* grown in the logarithmic phase, both with and without surfactin treatment, for RNA-seq sequencing.

## Background
In previous experiments ([see here](link)), growth curves of *P. dendritiformis* with varying concentrations of surfactin were analyzed, determining the optimal conditions as 12.5 µM surfactin and a 20-hour incubation to reach the logarithmic phase. 

## Materials
- *Paenibacillus dendritiformis* culture
- LB media
- Surfactin solution (1 mg/mL, contains ethanol)
- Incubator (30°C, 200 RPM)
- Fume hood
- Plate reader (600 nm OD measurements)
- Breathing test tubes
- RNA extraction kit ([protocol link](link))



## Procedure

### Day 1: Starter Culture Preparation
1. Prepare 6 starter cultures of *P. dendritiformis* in LB.
2. Incubate overnight at 30°C, 200 RPM.

### Day 2: Experimental Setup
#### 1. Dilution of Starter Cultures
- Dilute each starter culture 1:10 with fresh LB in breathing test tubes.
- Incubate for 3 hours at 30°C, 200 RPM.

#### 2. Surfactin Preparation
- Calculate the volume of surfactin solution needed to reach 12.5 µM in a final volume of 5 mL.
  - Calculation:  
  **Mass (g) = Concentration (mol/L) × Volume (L) × MW (g/mol)**

      Mass = (12.5 × 10⁻⁶ mol/L) × (5000 × 10⁻⁶ L) × (1036.3 g/mol)

      Mass ≈ 6.477 × 10⁻5 g

      **Volume (µL) = Mass (g) / Concentration (g/µL)**

      Volume ≈ 65 µL


- Pipette 65 µL of surfactin (ethanol) solution into a breathing tube and add 35 µL of LB. Repeat for three tubes (treatment replicates).
- Prepare three control tubes with 100 µL of LB.
- Allow all tubes to sit in the hood for 3 hours for ethanol evaporation.

#### 3. Bacterial OD Adjustment - back to the incubated test tubes
- Measure OD at 600 nm of bacterial cultures using a plate reader.
- Adjust OD to 0.1 by diluting with LB as needed.

#### 4. Addition to Treatment and Control Tubes
- Add 4900 µL of bacterial culture (OD 0.1) to each treatment and control tube (which are in the hood). Each test tube with bacteria for one tube in the hood. no mixing.
- Incubate tubes at 30°C, 200 RPM, for 20 hours.

### Day 3: OD Verification and RNA Extraction
1. Measure OD at 600 nm after 20 hours and compare with previous results ([here](link)) to confirm logarithmic phase.
2. Extract RNA from all 6 tubes following the [RNA extraction protocol](link).
